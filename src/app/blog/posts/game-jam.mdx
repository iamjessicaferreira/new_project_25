# I COULDN'T KEEP THIS EXPERIENCE TO MYSELF:

At first, I believe many of us know someone who is passionate about Game Jams, don't you? But as someone who had never participated in one (until this point), I didn’t quite understand the excitement around them... but this has changed.

While researching technology events I could join around my city, I stumbled upon the "Game Jam das Minas": an event focused on women and thought to myself, "what could be a better way to start my game jams adventure than being surrounded by amazing women?" and I was absolutely right! There was no better experience to kickstart my journey in the gaming industry.

When I went to Jam das Minas, I had no idea what it took to become a Game Developer, but today, I can proudly say that I’ve taken some small yet significant steps toward that goal, and more importantly, I’ve had the chance to meet so many inspiring and talented people in the field.

The Game Jam das Minas exceeded every expectation I had! It taught me so much about collaboration, teamwork, and the importance of surrounding ourselves with incredible and motivating individuals.

A special thank you to Diorama Digital for giving life and voice to this project, which has truly transformed my perspective on game development, and a huge thank you to my team, whose dedication and contributions made our project far better than we had ever imagined.

With the theme "Manguetown," we created "Da Lama ao Ca$h," in only 2 DAYS! You can check out the results of this adventure through the link [here](#) (P.S.: Please access it via a PC.)

Pride, dedication, and gratitude are the words that best define this experience. Thank you all so much, I hope you enjoy the game!
